Write a Java code that will take a year as input and print whether that year is a leap year or not.     
A year may be a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4.
Years that are divisible by 100 (century years such as 1900 or 2100) cannot be leap years unless they are also divisible by 400 (1600 or 2000). 

Sample Input: 2020
Output: 2020 is a leap year
Sample Input: 2001
Output: 2001 is not a leap year
Sample Input: 1900
Output: 1900 is not a leap year
Sample Input: 2000
Output: 2000 is a leap year

Code:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class task6{
  public static void main(String[]args){
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int year=sc.nextInt();
           if(year%4==0){
             if(year%100==0 && year%400==0){
        System.out.println(year+" is a leap year");
      }
       else if(year%100==0){
        System.out.println(year+" is not a leap year");
      }
        else if(year%400!=0){
        System.out.println(year+" is a leap year");
        }
           }else{
System.out.println(year+" is not a leap year");
}
  }
}
