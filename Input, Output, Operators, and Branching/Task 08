Hints:
The first two digits denote the year the student got enrolled
The 3rd digit denotes the session Student joined 
(Spring→1, Summer→3, Fall→2) 

Sample Input: 16101307
Output: Student Joined BRAC in Spring 16
Sample Input: 19301307
Output: Student Joined BRAC in Summer 19
Sample Input: 20201307
Output: Student Joined BRAC in Fall 20

Code;
public class task8{
  public static void main(String[]args){
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int id=sc.nextInt();
        int x=id/100000;
        int y=x%10;
        int z=id/1000000;
              if(y==1){
        System.out.println("Student joined BRAC in Spring "+z);
      }
       else if(y==2){
        System.out.println("Student joined BRAC in Fall "+z);
      }
         else{
         System.out.println("Student joined BRAC in Summer "+z);
}
  }
}
