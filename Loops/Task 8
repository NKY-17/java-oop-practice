Write a java program that takes 2 integer numbers as input and calculates how many prime numbers exist between them.

Sample Input:
10 
15
Sample Output:
There are 2 prime numbers between 10 and 15.
Sample Input:
150 
100
Sample Output:
There are 10 prime numbers between 100 and 150.

Code:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class task8{
  public static void main(String[]args){
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in); 
int x=sc.nextInt();
int y=sc.nextInt();
int c=0;
if(x>y){
  int z=x;
  x=y;
  y=z;
}
for(int i=x+1;i<y;i++){
boolean prime=true;
for(int j=2;j*j<=i;j++){
  if(i%j==0){
    prime=false;
    break;
  }
}
if(prime){
  c++;
}
  }
  System.out.println(c+" prime number between "+x+" and "+y);
}
  }
